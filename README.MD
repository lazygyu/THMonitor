# What is this?

This is a simple code for a NodeMCU board with a DHT22 sensor. This will keep measuring the temperature and humidity and report a number in the URI periodically.

# How to use this?

## Requirements

* Arduino IDE
* A NodeMCU board
* A DHT22 sensor
* Libraries for NodeMCU boards and DHT sensors installed.

## Build

1. Clone this repository
2. Put in some values for your environment to `constants.h`
3. Use Arduino IDE for to compile and upload this code into the board.
